# cosmosAirdropChecker
This is a tool we are building to streamline the process of finding and claiming airdrops on the Cosmos network.
Most websites have a list of which airdrops are available, but do not check if your address is eligible, this tool will.  

# Usage
1) Using python3, run backend.py
2) Open the html site in your browser
3) Input your Cosmos address
